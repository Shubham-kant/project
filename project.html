<p>Law Minister invokes Shah Bano case; Ananth Kumar says Centre will strive for consensus in Rajya Sabha to get the Bill passed
Union Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad invoked the Shah Bano case at the BJP’s Parliamentary Party meeting on Thursday, saying that unlike Congress Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not bow down on triple talaq.
<br><br>
Mr. Prasad briefed the BJP MPs on the triple talaq legislation which was passed in the Lok Sabha earlier in the day.
<br>
“Rajiv Gandhi had bowed down to the lobbies and left the Shah Bano case mid-way. Our Prime Minister Narendra Modi will not let any injustice against Muslim women,” he reportedly told the members.
<br><br>
<b>Process on</b><br>
Responding to a question on consensus on the legislation in Rajya Sabha where the Opposition has an upper hand, Parliamentary Affairs Minister Ananth Kumar said after its passage in the Lok Sabha, the government would initiate the process of evolving a consensus in the Upper House.
<br><br>
He said the process, in fact has already begun.
<br><br>
Briefing presspersons on the proceedings of the weekly BJP Parliamentary Party meeting, Mr. Kumar said the Prime Minister appealed for a consensus in passage of the Muslim Women Protection of Rights on Marriage Bill.
<br><br>
Eminent jurist and former Attorney-General Soli Sorabjee, on Thursday appealed not to bring religion into the triple talaq Bill.
<br><br>
“It’s a very good move that requires legislation. Don’t bring religion into it as the whole thrust of the legislation is to ensure gender equality and to see women are not treated in an arbitrary manner,” he said. He also said that the Bill was being opposed for the vested interests.
<br><br>
The legislation would ensure gender equality, he added.

<p id="para1"><b>Ambani dials Ambani: Jio to buy RCom's mobile biz assets for Rs 24,000 cr</b></p>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\PICS\news2.jpg" align="Centre">
<p>Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio announced a deal on Thursday to acquire younger brother Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications’s (RCom’s) wireless infrastructure assets, including towers and spectrum, at an estimated price of Rs 20,000-24,000 crore. The historic deal between the brothers came on their father Dhirubhai Ambani’s 85th birth anniversary. 
<br>
The two companies have signed binding agreements and the proceeds would be used to pre-pay RCom’s bank loans. 
<br><br>
“Jio emerged as the highest bidder in a transparent process conducted under the supervision of a high-powered bid evaluation committee, comprising experts from banking, telecom and law. The company will utilise the proceeds of the monetisation of this cash deal solely for pre-payment of debt to its lenders,” RCom said in a statement. 
<br><br>
Jio, which has disrupted the Indian telecom sector after the launch of its free voice service last September, will acquire 122.4 MHz of 4G spectrum in the 800/900/1800/2100 MHz bands, over 43,000 towers, around 178,000 route km of fibre with a pan-Indian footprint, and 248 media convergence nodes, covering 5 million sq ft used for hosting telecom infrastructure. These assets are expected to contribute significantly to the large scale roll-out of wireless and fibre to home and enterprise services by Jio.  
<br>
Both companies said the transactions would close in a phased manner over the next three months ending March 2018, subject to approvals from lenders.The acquisition will put Jio in charge of a sizeable spectrum band even as the telco has already disrupted the sector over the past one and a half year.  Jio holds almost 14 per cent of the telecom market share by adjusted gross revenue, according to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) numbers and has been steadily rolling out freebies to telecom subscribers to grab market share.
<br><br>
Apart from this transaction, RCom would also sell real estate and minority stake to reduce its debt by 87 per cent to Rs 6,000 crore. 
<br><br>
The company had earlier announced plans to sell prime real estate across New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata and Navi Mumbai. The Jio acquisition does not include real estate assets. 
<br><br>
SBI, IDBI Bank, Bank of Baroda are among the top lenders to RCom. The company was also able to convince China Development Bank, one of its large lenders, to withdraw a National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) petition to recover Rs 9,600-cro</p>

<p id="para1"><b>New Generation Maruti Suzuki Swift Spied In India Ahead Of Launch</b></p>
<img src="C:\Users\HP\Desktop\PICS\news3.jpg">
<p>The Maruti Suzuki Swift is one of the most popular hatchbacks in the country and the automaker is gearing up to introduce the new generation version very soon. The all-new Swift will be making its India debut at the 2018 Auto Expo before being officially available at dealerships later in the year. While the launch is still a few weeks away, the all-new Maruti Suzuki Swift was caught completely undisguised while being shot for its TV commercial. A major departure over its predecessor, the new generation Maruti Suzuki Swift gets a lighter and stronger chassis, completely new design and comprehensive new feature list.<br><br>

At the outset, the new generation Maruti Suzuki Swift is based on the completely new HEARTECT platform. The same frame underpins the new generation Dzire as well, which is doing stupendously well on the sales front. The HEARTECT platform is about 10-15 per cent lighter, which is expected to give both power and fuel economy a healthy boost. It will also be more fun to drive thanks to the car's lower centre of gravity, while the chassis is about 10 per cent stiffer. The axle tracks are wider as well, as the car aims to be more fun to drive than its predecessor.
<br><br>
In terms of styling, the new generation Maruti Suzuki Swift gets a smoother design. The bold single frame grille takes prominence flanked by the bug-like headlamps. The top-spec trims will get LED DRLs and projector lens as well, while the rear will get LED taillights. The curvaceous design complements the hatchback well. Inside, the car gets a sporty appeal with a minimalistic setup.
<br><br>
 The material qualities will see a lot of improvement, while you will also get a completely new steering wheel setup, twin-pod instrument cluster, new centre console and the SmartPlay Infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto. Other features will include auto headlamps and wipers, climate control and a lot more. Expect better cabin space as well, especially at the rear; along with improved boot space.

Under the hood, the all-new Maruti Suzuki Swift will continue using the same 1.2-litre K-Series petrol and 1.3-litre DDiS diesel engines. Both units will come paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox, while an AMT option is likely to be offered with both engines. 
<br><br>
That said, the new Swift will make its debut at the Auto Expo next February with much fanfare. The model will compete against a host of offerings in this segment including the Ford Figo and the Hyundai Grand i10. Make sure to keep watching this space for more details about the all-new Swift.</p>
